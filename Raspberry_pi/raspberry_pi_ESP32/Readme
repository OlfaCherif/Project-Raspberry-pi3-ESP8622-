The file "Generate PWM 1Mhz" is for raspberry pi.

In this project we will be using C++ for coding the raspberry 
We used the Geany's programmer's editor for C++ code
We used C++ to control the hardware GPIO and generate high frequencies and makes the transducers work correctly and send ultrasounds.
The WiringPi is the only C++ library which controls the hardware PWM pin.

In the other hand, we will be reading ultrasounds on the Esp32 and calculate the waterflow.
